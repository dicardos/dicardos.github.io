about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Diego Cardoso, I’m a Data & Analytics Leader with a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data science projects. I hold a BSc in Statistics from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) and an MSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of São Paulo (Poli-USP). My professional journey has taken me through pivotal roles in the banking, telecommunications, and energy sectors.
  
  During my academic tenure, I also had the opportunity to study in Canada as part of the Science Without Borders program, further enhancing my expertise and cross-cultural adaptability. My experience encompasses advanced coursework, research projects, and practical applications of data science and machine learning.
  
  I am passionate about leveraging data to inform strategic decisions and enhance operational efficiencies. I specialize in applying my knowledge to solve complex business problems, driving innovative solutions that deliver measurable results.
