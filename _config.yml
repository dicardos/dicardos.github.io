about_content: |
  Hi, my name is Diego Cardoso, I’m a Data & Analytics Leader with a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data science projects. I hold a BSc in Statistics from the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) and an MSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of São Paulo (Poli-USP). My professional journey has taken me through pivotal roles in the banking, telecommunications, and energy sectors.
  
  During my academic tenure, I also had the opportunity to study in Canada as part of the Science Without Borders program, further enhancing my expertise and cross-cultural adaptability. My experience encompasses advanced coursework, research projects, and practical applications of data science and machine learning.
  
  I am passionate about leveraging data to inform strategic decisions and enhance operational efficiencies. I specialize in applying my knowledge to solve complex business problems, driving innovative solutions that deliver measurable results.

          I have extensive experience in data and analytics, having held various roles at Santander, including Data Scientist, Consultant, Coordinator, and Manager. I began working with vehicle financing, where I led several data projects involving customer, product, and offer analysis to increase portfolio profitability and identify cross-selling opportunities. Subsequently, I moved to the CRM B2B department, specializing in the Small and Mid-size Enterprise (SME) segment. Currently, within the CRM team, I am responsible for analytics and modeling, developing data-driven strategies to provide actionable insights for SMEs.

           During my time at Vivo (Telefônica Brasil), I analyzed large datasets to identify trends and insights, developed and maintained dashboards for real-time data visualization, and conducted in-depth analysis to understand customer behavior and preferences. I developed Machine Learning models to classify customers who are more likely to purchase mobile phone products, constructed the Next Best Offer algorithm to define sales offers, and developed credit scores using telco data. Additionally, I worked through business cases and played the role of a consultant focusing on monetizing telco data by identifying and creating new revenue streams.

          During my internship, I developed Machine Learning models to predict sugarcane mill output, total recoverable sugar content (TRS), and tonnes of sugarcane per hectare (TCH). I also utilized clustering techniques and descriptive statistical analysis to evaluate planting failures using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images.
